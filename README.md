# vim-monochromes

Four colors chemes that are easy on the eyes and try to avoid contrast when it makes sense. Diffs, selections are still
meaningfully colored.

Available flavors are:

- `monochrome-dark`
- `monochrome-light`
- `monochrome-solarized-dark` WIP
- `monochrome-solarized-light` WIP


Those color themes are based on [fxn/vim-monochrome](https://github.com/fxn/vim-monochrome).
